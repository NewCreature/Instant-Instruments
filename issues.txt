Instant Instruments Issues
--------------------------

[X]Consolidate core instrument code. A lot of the functionality is shared
   amongst all of the instrument types.

   [X]Instruments should be assigned a channel at creation time.

[X]Improve auto start of FluidSynth. We need to see if it is already running
   before attempting to start it ourselves. If it is already running, we should
   not kill it when we exit.

   Sometimes the FluidSynth device is not listed after starting the server. We
   should probably retry looking for it and possibly retry starting it if it's
   not found the first time.

[X]Disable instrument controls when the instrument function key is held.

[ ]Add graphical UI.

[ ]Implement shifting the base note for each instrument by a relnote.

[ ]Add metronome.

[ ]Add built-in drum tracks.

[ ]Add ability to change the current BPM. This setting should affect the
   metronome and drum tracks.
