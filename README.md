## Getting Started

UAfter opening Instant Instruments, you can immediately start playing sounds and
music using any of the three available input methods.

### Instant Piano

The piano layout is as follows:

     2 3   5 6 7   9 0
    Q W E R T Y U I O P

     S D   G H J   L ;
    Z X C V B N M , . /

The keys are mapped to mimic the layout of a piano. Press and hold any of the
keys listed above to play notes. Holding Ctrl while pressing a key will play a
chord with that key's note as its base note.

Each row of piano keys has its own function key which can be used in combination
with other keys to change the settings for that particular piano. The top row
function key is '1' and the bottom row function key is 'A'.

Holding the function key while pressing the Up or Down key will change the
program (instrument sound) used by that row. Holding the function key while
pressing the Left or Right key will change the base note by one octave. You can
also select a MIDI program directly by typing a program number on the number pad
while holding the function key.

### Instant Guitar

Hold your keyboard in your hands with the top edge resting in your left palm.
Now you can play your instant guitar. Here is the default note layout:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
	C   C#  D   D#  E   F   F#  G   G#   A  A#   B

	                                        Right Shift (Strum)

Holding an individual key while pressing the Strum key will trigger an
individual note. Hold two adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a chord. Holding two non-adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a power chord.

You can switch to this alternate layout with the Tab key:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D    E   F   G

The function key for the guitar is Escape. Holding Escape while pressing the Up
or Down key will change the program used by the guitar. Holding Escape while
pressing the Left or Right key will change the base note by one octave.
