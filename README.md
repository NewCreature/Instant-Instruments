# Instant Instruments

Instant Instruments allows you to interface with your PC's built-in software
synthesizer using something you already have connected to your PC, your
keyboard. You can use either a guitar- or piano-style interface.

## Instant Piano

The piano layout is as follows:

     2 3   5 6 7   9 0
    Q W E R T Y U I O P

     S D   G H J   L ;
    Z X C V B N M , . /

Each row of piano keys can be customized to play different instruments and
octaves.

## Instant Guitar

Hold your keyboard in your hands with the top edge resting in your left palm.
Now you can play your instant guitar. Here is the default note layout:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
	C   C#  D   D#  E   F   F#  G   G#   A  A#   B

	                                        Right Shift (Strum)

Holding an individual key while pressing the Strum key will trigger an
individual note. Hold two adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a chord. Holding two non-adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a power chord.

You can switch to this alternate layout with the Tab key:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D    E   F   G
