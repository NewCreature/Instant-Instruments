# Instant Instruments

Instant Instruments allows you to interface with your PC's built-in software
synthesizer using something you already have connected to your PC, your
keyboard. You can use either a guitar-, piano-, or drum-style interface.

After opening Instant Instruments, you can immediately start playing sounds and
music using any of the three available input methods.

## Instant Piano

The piano layout is as follows:

     2 3   5 6 7   9 0
    Q W E R T Y U I O P

     S D   G H J   L ;
    Z X C V B N M , . /

Each row of piano keys can be customized to play different instruments and
octaves (not implemented yet).

Each row of piano keys has its own function key which can be used in combination
with other keys to change the settings for that particular piano. The top row
function key is '1' and the bottom row function key is 'A'. Holding the function
key while pressing the Up or Down key will change the program (instrument sound)
used by that row.

## Instant Guitar

Hold your keyboard in your hands with the top edge resting in your left palm.
Now you can play your instant guitar. Here is the default note layout:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
	C   C#  D   D#  E   F   F#  G   G#   A  A#   B

	                                        Right Shift (Strum)

Holding an individual key while pressing the Strum key will trigger an
individual note. Hold two adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a chord. Holding two non-adjacent keys while pressing the Strum key will
trigger a power chord.

You can switch to this alternate layout with the Tab key:

    F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6  F7  F8  F9  F10 F11 F12
    C   D   E   F   G   A   B   C   D    E   F   G

The function key for the guitar is Escape. Holding Escape while pressing the Up
or Down key will change the program used by the guitar.
